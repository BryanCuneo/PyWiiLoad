1.2 (Current Release):
* Now uses the environment variable $WII="[Wii's IP]".  This allows you to use
  the same variable for programs like FTP (ftpii) since there is no "tcp:"
  before the IP.  (PyWiiLoad will continue to support $WIILOAD="tcp:[Wii's IP]"
  until version 2.0.

1.1.1:
* Fixed the crash in 1.1

1.1:
* Versions for Python 3 and 2 have been combined into one file.

1.0:
* The first release that I'm satisfied with. The Python 2 and 3 versions both
  function correctly.
