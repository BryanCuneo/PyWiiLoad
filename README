PyWiiLoad is a rewrite of wiiload.py (http://pastebin.com/4nWAkBpw).  The main
improvement is automatic zip archiving of directories (Wiiload can't send dirs).
It also provides smooth error handling and the option for a user to input their
Wii's IP address if $WIILOAD isn't set.  The code itself has been changed quite a
bit, but that doesn't affect the user (or shouldn't anyway).  For license
information, please see the COPYING file.  A port to Python 3 is available in the
"Python3" branch.

General Wiiload info: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiiload

Requirements:
1) An Internet-connected  Wii with The Homebrew Channel installed
2) A computer connected to the same network as the Wii
3) The environment variable $WIILOAD set to "tcp:[your Wii's IP]"
   # Not entirely necessary, you can set it within the program, but that only
   # works for one run.

If you're not sure what your Wii's IP address is, open up the HBC, hit the
Home button on your Wii Remote and look in the upper left-hand corner of the
screen.

You can send executables or zip archives with Wiiload.  Before you send
anything, make sure that your Wii is on and the HBC launched.  Any programs
that you send will boot automatically, zip files will ask you for confirmation
before being extracted and installed to the SD card.

Executables should just be a .elf or .dol file.  To send one, run one of these
commands:
./wiiload.py /path/to/boot.elf
./wiiload.py /path/to/boot.dol

Sending a zip file is used to install an application to the SD card.  It needs
to contain just the files you want added to the SD:/apps/ folder.  I.e.
syscheck.zip would contain this file structure:
syscheck/
syscheck/boot.dol
syscheck/icon.png
syscheck/meta.xml

Since most programs come with a zipped apps folder, you'll have to unzip it and
recompress it the right way before you can send it.  If you send an incorrectly
formed .zip the HBC will give you the error "This is not a usable ZIP file."
You can send a zip file like this:
./wiiload.py /path/to/appname.zip

If you try to send a directory with PyWiiLoad you will be asked if you want to
compress it to a zip archive and send it or exit the program.  If you want to
zip the directory, answer "y" at the prompt.  Otherwise, just type "n."
